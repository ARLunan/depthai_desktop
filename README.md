#depthai_desktop

Packages on this repo (<u>https://github.com/ARLunan</u>) for interacting with Luxonis OAK-D-LITE depthai Camera data with a Ubuntu 22.04 Development Desktop machine configured with ROS2 Humble & Luxonis **depthai-ros** repo. See also **depthai_robot** package in my repo for other SBC Controller Launch files with further convenient Camera and Rviz parameters defined.

Step 1: Visit the Luxonis Depthai Github to install the dependancies:. <u>https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ros </u> on the SBC controller and Development Desktop machines. Follow the "Install from ros binaries and Execute an example ROS2". 

Checkout the code and Camera connection: Run a launch command on the Ubuntu 22.04/ROS2 Humble SBC Robot Controller with a connected Luxonis OAK-D-Lite to Publish Camera Data, for example:  

The command _~/ros2 launch depthai_examples stereo_inertial_node camera_model:=OAK-D-LITE enableRviz:=True_ (default) displays Camera data on the SBC Controller Desktop GUI with **rviz** configured with _stereoIntertialDepthAlignROS2.rviz file_  

The depthai-ros packge has 4 launch files that can be run on the SBC Robot Controller with their default configuration to launch **rviz** to display the Camera Data locally.  
___  
| # | Launch .py file                | .rviz file used                   | Executable Name      |
| - | -------------------------------| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1 | mobile_publisher.launch.py     | pointCloud.rviz                   | mobilenet_node       |
| 2 | rgb_publisher.launch.py        | default.rviz                      | rgb_stereo_node      |
| 3 | stereo_inertial_node.launch.py | stereoInertialDepthAlignROS2.rviz | stereo_inertial_node |
| 4 | stereo.launch.py               | stereoPointCloud.rviz             | stereo_node          |

Step 2: On a Linux Development Desktop, Ubuntu 22.04 ROS2 Humble -desktop (or -full) (_~:sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop_) Published Camera Image data msgs can be displayed by Node Subscribed msgs in a network connected Desktop RVIZ by running, for example: _~: ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d /home/ubuntu/depthai/rviz/stereoInertialDepthAlignROS2.rviz_ . Copy the **rviz** file to this location from the /opt/ros/humble/share/depth_examples/launch/rviz/" folder. Or simply run _~: ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_imageview_

Step 3: The Launch Files in this **depthai_desktop** repository installed and compiled in a workspace (e.g. depthai_ws/src) that includes a **depthai_viz** package are equivalent to running the above **rviz** launch commands embedded in each, for each of the above 4 commands that are **run** on the SBC Robot controller, respectively.

Step 4: Run one of the above SBC Controller and corresponding Developement Desktop launch files:  (Use for example, the Step 1 launch example with enableRviz:=False .

\#1. ~: ros2 launch depthai_viz view_mobilePublisher.launch.py 

\#2. ~: ros2 launch depthai_viz view_rgbStereoNode.launch.py 

\#3. ~: ros2 launch depthai_viz view_stereoIertialDepthAlign.launch.py 

\#4. ~: ros2 launch depthai_viz view_stereo.launch.py  

Note that the 4 .rviz files used in these launch files are the same as those in the Luxonis **depthai-ros/depthai_examples** package.

**Camera tip**
Use a short (< 1m) usb-c to usb-b (blue) cable and a "USB-C Power/Data Splitter" to power the camera with its dedicated 5vdc power.
